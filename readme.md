## Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jin-adcapsule/52switch-backend.git
   cd 52switch-backend
   ```
### Step 2. Configure required files in correct directories:
   Ensure this is placed in the correct directories (contact the project owner if unsure):
   ```plaintext
   src/main/resources/52switch_firebase_key.json
   ``` 

### Step 3: Run the setup script in root:
   On Linux/Mac:
   ```bash
      bash setup.sh 
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```bash
      setup.bat
   ```
### Step 4. Configure environment files:
   Update the following file with your backend environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   52switch-backend/.env
   ```

### Step 5. (Recommended) Run firebase emulator:
   ```bash
   $root/firebase emulators:start
   ```
### Step 6. Run server:
   Environment clean and setup:
   ```bash
   $root/mvn clean install
   ```
   With firebase emulator, edit first this file and then run:
   ```bash
   $root/.\run_with_env.ps1
   ```
   Or without firebase emulator:
   ```bash
   $root/mvn spring-boot:run    
   ```
